        <p><strong>bourag</strong> is a famous Algerien dish that is traditionally served in ramadan as a side dish.</p>
        <h2>ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb. ground beef</li>
            <li>1 small white onion</li>
            <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
            <li>¾ tsp. black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp. curry</li>
            <li>1 tsp. allspice</li>
            <li>¼ cup Italian parsley</li>
            <li>1 package eggroll wrappers</li>
            <li>oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Brown ground beef in a skillet, breaking up any large clumps. Add minced onion to the pan, and saute until soft.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle salt, pepper, and remaining spices over the meat. Add chopped parsley and cook for an additional minute. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>When the filling is ready, place one egg roll wrapper in front of you. Add approximately two tablespoons of filling close to the bottom edge of the wrapper.</li>
            <li>Lift the bottom edge of the egg roll wrapper over the filling. Next, fold sides of the wrappers over the filling and roll up into a "cigar." Seal the corner with a dab of water, and repeat.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large frying pan to 375-degrees F. Carefully place a few bourak in the pan. Fry until golden brown, and do the same with the rest.</li>
            <li>Drain fried bourak on a paper towel-lined plate. Serve while hot.</li>
        </ol>
